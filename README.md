## Email Phishing Detection

This project is a web-based application designed to detect phishing emails by analyzing email content, sender domains, and embedded URLs. It integrates a custom-trained BERT-based deep learning model, achieving an accuracy of 87.1%, with VirusTotalâ€™s API to provide a robust phishing detection system. This allows users to identify and manage potentially malicious emails directly from their Gmail inbox.
